#Overflow: We could represent this like a conditional statement (if / else). Depending on a particular condition, it'll do a or b.

print("Welcome to the Rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What's your height in cm?\n"))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride rollercoaster!")
else:
    print("You can't go right now. Come back when you've grown up.")
