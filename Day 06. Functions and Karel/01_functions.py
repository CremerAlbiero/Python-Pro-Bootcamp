# python already has built-in functions. But it's also possible to create specific functions.
#function().  len(), print()... all are functions.

#defining a function
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

#execute the function, line by line.
my_function()


#Defining Functions():
  # Do this
  # Then do thus
  # Finally do this
